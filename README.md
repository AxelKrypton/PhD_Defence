# PhD_Defence
[This](https://github.com/AxelKrypton/PhD_Defence/releases/download/presented/Defence.pdf) is the presentation of my Ph.D. defence, which took place at J. W. Goethe Universit√§t (Frankfurt am Main) on 21/04/2017.
If you are interested in knowing more about the work, my Ph.D. thesis is also [available](https://github.com/AxelKrypton/PhD_Thesis).

## Additional information

### Structure of the presentation

Due to the 20 minutes time constraint I had for my presentation, I decided to gather all the work done during my Ph.D. on the first slide, which was then repeated after the summary and left on the beamer for the question session. This second version of such a slide is indeed clickable and, from it, it was possible to quickly access all the backup slides if necessary. From each of these, using the clickable label on the left edge, the overview slide can be reached again. To maximally enjoy the clickable feature of the presentation, the user is encouraged to display it in full screen mode.

### Some known issues

For some reason I ignore, the title slide seems to be kind of problematic. In particular,
- the colours are not correctly desplayed [here](Defence.pdf) on GitHub;
- it is not at all desplayed downloading the file and opening with some pdf viewer like Acrobat Reader.

Anyway, as far as I know, opening the presentation in full screen mode should display it correctly.

### TeXnical aspects

The decision of not publishing the source code of the presentation is due to the fact I did not released yet the beamer theme I used. I still want to work on it in order to bring it into an acceptable shape. Apart from that, the main used package was [PGF](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf). In particular, `shapes`, `arrows`, `calc`, `positioning`, `mindmap`, `shadings` and `spy` were, among others, the main TikZ libraries that were used. The [beamer class](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer) [documentation](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf) was of crucial help, even though often not sufficient. [TeX stack exchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/) was then the main resource used.
